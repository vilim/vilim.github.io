## A neural circuit for processing social motion cues in the juvenile zebrafish brain

Johannes Kappel

[jkappel@neuro.mpg.de](mailto:jkappel@neuro.mpg.de)

Abstract  

Social interactions rely on the ability of each animal to recognize conspecifics based on sensory cues such as visual appearance. However, the perceptual mechanisms by which the vertebrate brain processes visual conspecific cues to regulate social behavior are largely unknown. In a recent study, we found that juvenile zebrafish are specifically attracted to the characteristic motion dynamics underlying discrete swim bouts of same-age conspecifics (Larsch & Baier, 2018). Here, we used this well-defined visual cue to identify neural correlates of social recognition across the juvenile zebrafish brain. By performing functional two-photon calcium imaging in the head-immobilized animal, we recorded neuronal responses in the forebrain and midbrain to a moving black dot. To observe which neurons preferentially respond to physiologically relevant stimulus conditions, we systematically changed the motion from continuous to bout-like dynamics. By developing a flexible regression model to capture response characteristics of each neuron to the different stimuli, we extracted neuronal clusters whose tuning matched behavioral preference in the virtual reality assay. We discovered that neurons in specific areas of the tectum and forebrain encode motion with characteristic bout structure, with spatial clusters exhibiting varying degrees of tuning. In summary, we functionally identified candidate brain areas and neurons that might be involved in the perception and processing of visual conspecific cues. Future studies including targeted ablations and holographic optogenetic stimulation combined with behavioral readout will reveal which neurons are crucial for social recognition and social affiliation.




## Unraveling the logic of synaptic organization in neocortex

Abstract

The system that converts perceptions of the external world to complex internal representations in our body is the latest developed part of the mammalian brain– neocortex. It is a dense network, whose synapses or connections are determined by the integration of several properties that range from the genetic to the cellular level. Reducing this dense network into its constituent parts allows us to win detailed insight at a particular scale but has so far defied a generalized mechanistic understanding of connectivity in the brain. Our perspective emphasizes that a simple connectivity rule constrained to the geometry of the system may generate dense artificial networks consistent with the rich variety of empirical connectivity measurements. The connectivity rule is a set containing zero, one, or many mathematical functions applied to subcellular neuronal structures, such as presynaptic elements (i.e., axonal boutons) and postsynaptic targets (i.e., dendritic spines and surface areas). The geometry of the system is determined by a computational framework that allows us to emulate the experimental conditions of in vivo- and in vitro-based studies. For example, neuron type, neuron morphology, neuron molecular marker, slice orientation, slice thickness, recording depth from the slice surface, and distance between the neurons. An empirical connectivity measurement is a characterization of the underlying dense network, usually reported in the form of fraction of measured connected pairs. Using simulation-based inference and uncertainty quantification we show how multiple distinct rules of synaptic organization are able to independently reproduce several landmark studies observing pairwise connection probabilities. Furthermore, we mathematically demonstrated it. This suggests that fist-order statistics alone reveal loose organizational principles. To conclude, higher-order statistics such as correlation of neuron populations or circuit motifs would allow us to better characterize dense cortical networks, and test them experimentally. This would provide connectivity rules with tighter bounds, and thus, a better understanding on how synapses in neocortex are organized.




## Nonlinear Interaction Decomposition: A Novel Framework for Detection of Nonlinear Interactions in Human Brain

Mina Jamshidi Idaji

[jamshidi@cbs.mpg.de](mailto:jamshidi@cbs.mpg.de)

Abstract 

Perceptual, motor and cognitive performance depends strongly on the connectivity between remote brain areas. Such connectivity can be manifested through neuronal phase synchronization in specific frequency bands (e.g., alpha, beta or gamma frequency ranges). However, a synchronization within the same frequency limits a range of neuronal populations which can engage in the processing of information due to the fact that often different brain areas produce oscillations at different frequencies. In this case neuronal interactions can be carried out through cross-frequency coupling (CFC). However, this type of interactions is hard to detect and interpret due to mixing problems caused by volume conduction and due to non-sinusoidal nature of neuronal oscillations which mimics CFS. Here, we propose a new method – non-linear interaction decomposition (NID) – which compactly describes CFC in terms of a few interacting neuronal components reliably capturing CFC. The original contribution of this study lies in the demonstration that the principle of independence, typically utilized for the extraction of individual sources, can be successfully used for the extraction of non-linearly coupled neuronal sources. Our approach is based on the idea that a linear mixture of a large class of non-linearly coupled sources has a more non-Gaussian distribution than any of the individual sources. Such mixture represents a chimera signal whose non-Gaussianity guarantees extraction of non-linearly coupled processes. Using realistic head modeling with a few pairs of coupled sources and with different levels of background 1/f noise, we show that NID reliably extracts interacting components even for a challenging situation of signal-to-noise ratio being 0.1. Additionally, we applied NID to EEG dataset consisting of 82 subjects recorded at the resting state. NID recovered short- and long-distance interactions between the two hemispheres, or between central, parietal, and occip- ital areas. For instance, the connection between sensori- motor and occipital areas can be observed easily in both hemispheres, which suggests the existence of interactions between beta-central and alpha-occipital areas. These may be viewed as a functional substrate for visuo-motor integration.




## Prefrontal-hippocampal interactions in goal-directed navigation

[zahra.golipour@brain.mpg.de](mailto:zahra.golipour@brain.mpg.de)

Abstract 

While decades of neuroscience research have focused on the formation of internal spatial maps by using place cells or grid cells, goal directed navigation requires another key element; the estimation of the position of the destination before the animal reaches there. In accordance with this idea, several studies have reported that hippocampal neurons not only represent the animal’s instantaneous position but also reflect the animal’s next trajectory by changing their firing rates or spike sequences. However, whether the hippocampus is the structure that determines the next goal, or such information is transferred from other brain structures is unclear. We hypothesized that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be the source of the goal representation, because of its anatomical connections with the hippocampal and para-hippocampal structures as well as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex for action execution. To test this hypothesis, we designed a new behavioral task. This is because conventional behavioral tasks typically have multiple route options to reach only one or two goals (e.g. T-maze). However, many neurons in the brain are known to change their activity depending on routes, making it difficult to differentiate between goal and route representations. We therefore decided to use a linear track with multiple goals, so that we can examine the activity change depending on different goals without a potential compound of trajectory-dependent changes. Rats with electrodes in PFC or in the hippocampus were required to target a specified water well (goal) out of 10 wells on the linear track, and the reward well changed multiple times during the recording session. We discovered that hippocampal cells distinguished not only running directions on the track but also change their firing rates depending on the location of the future goal. The hippocampus thus appears to have the information about the future goal. Similarly, we also found that PFC neurons fired differentially depending on the future goal locations. Importantly, the identity of the future goal can be decoded from PFC cells well before the animal reaches the destination. Therefore, our preliminary results are consistent with the idea that goal representation takes place in PFC. I further plan to analyze the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and PFC with simultaneous recordings or by perturbing the circuits that connect the two regions.




## Learning-related plasticity in auditory cortical circuits

Abstract

During learning a previously neutral stimulus can gain behavioural relevance through pairing with a reward or an aversive event. In sensory cortex bottom-up information about the basic features of the stimulus is processed and thought to converge with top-down information about the behavioural relevance of the stimulus. How the processing of the stimulus in cortex on the neuronal level changes with learning when these two information streams are integrated is not clear. In this study I investigated how the stimulus processing by different cortical circuits elements changes with learning. I combined 2-photon Ca2+ imaging in auditory cortex of the mouse with auditory fear conditioning and compared the neuronal responses to the conditioned stimulus before, when the stimulus was still neutral, and after learning, when it had gained behavioural relevance. 

I observed an increase in inhibition in cortical layer 1 provided by layer 1 interneurons and a pathway-specific change in neuronal population coding of the stimulus by layer 5 pyramidal neurons. How these two observations relate to each other needs further investigations.




## Encoding and enhancement of memory in a mouse spatial navigation task

Abstract  

We know from our own experience that learning with spaced, long inter-trial intervals generally creates more robust memories than training using massed, short intervals. This phenomenon is defined as the spacing effect, which is conserved across species and has been validated in a wide range of behavioral tasks. However, the neurobiological basis of the spacing effect has not been studied extensively in vivo. Since the possible underlying cellular and molecular processes are not instantaneous, but rather take place on a continuous timescale, a critical first step is studying the effect of systematic variations of inter-trial intervals (ITIs) on memory persistence. We adapted a delayed matching-to-place task that enabled us to probe spatial memory encoding and retrieval within individual animals over the course of dozens of training sessions. Specifically, twenty mice were trained in a radial arm maze to find a buried food reward by employing a win-stay strategy. Three encoding trials were conducted, either consecutively (‘massed training’; ITI of 0 minutes), or separated with a short, medium or long delay (‘spaced training’; ITI of 10, 30 or 60 minutes, respectively). After learning, we quantified short-term memory (2.5h post-encoding) or long-term memory performance (24h post-encoding). We made three key observations. First, memory encoding was interval dependent, with massed training leading to the best performance in the final training trial, and increasing interval lengths resulting in decreased performance. Second, focusing on spaced training intervals, long-term memory (24h) was impaired using an encoding ITI of 10 minutes as compared to an ITI of 30 or 60 minutes, while short-term spatial memory (2.5h) did not differ between ITI conditions. Third, after massed training, mice did not exhibit short-term memory for the rewarded location, but did exhibit long-term memory. These results point to a more complex interaction between ITI and memory persistence than previously described. These behavioral observations will be combined with in vivo functional imaging of medial prefrontal cortex neurons, using a head-mounted miniaturized microscope, relating learning strategies and memory performance to local circuit activity.




## A critical role for temporal neocortex processing in auditory threat memory

[tamas.dalmay@brain.mpg.de](mailto:tamas.dalmay@brain.mpg.de)

Abstract 

Memory for cues associated with threat is critical for survival, and a leading model for elucidating how sensory information is linked to adaptive behavior by learning. While the neural circuits mediating auditory threat memory have been intensely investigated, it remains unclear whether auditory cortex is critically involved. We address this question using a combination of optogenetic activity manipulations in defined cortical areas and output pathways, viral tracing, and pathway-specific in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal that auditory cortex is selectively required for memory to complex stimuli, while stimulus processing in adjacent temporal association cortex is vital for all forms of cued threat memory. This medio-temporal impact gradient is paralleled by the organization of projections to the lateral amygdala, which govern threat memory expression through a balanced form of population plasticity selectively supporting the discrimination of significant sensory stimuli. Neocortical processing thus plays a critical role for cued threat memory.




## Prefrontal state fluctuations control access to consciousness

[abhilash.dwarakanath@tuebingen.mpg.de](mailto:abhilash.dwarakanath@tuebingen.mpg.de)

Abstract

During perceptual ambiguity, the content of consciousness alternates spontaneously between different interpretations of the same sensory input. The source of these internally driven perceptual state transitions that could reveal the neural mechanisms triggering the emergence of non-conscious information to conscious awareness is unknown. Here we show that transient, low-frequency (1-9Hz) perisynaptic events in the macaque prefrontal cortex, precede spontaneous perceptual transitions in a no-report binocular motion rivalry task. These low-frequency transients briefly suppress a default prefrontal state of 20-40Hz (beta) bursts that selectively synchronise the discharge activity of perceptually dominant neuronal ensembles signalling conscious content. Similar state fluctuations dominate the prefrontal cortex during resting-state with dynamics resembling the temporal structure of perceptual alternations during rivalry. Our results suggest that under conditions of visual ambiguity prefrontal state fluctuations precede a reorganisation in the activity of feature specific neuronal ensembles resulting in a refresh of conscious content.


## Exploring the hindbrain circuit wiring scheme underlying visuomotor transformations

[malbanesi@neuro.mpg.de](mailto:malbanesi@neuro.mpg.de)

Abstract

The zebrafish larva can execute a large repertoire of behaviors driven by visual input. While we are starting to gain an understanding on how the visual input is processed in the retinorecipient areas, our understanding of the transformations that lead to the descending motor commands is still poor. \
I will present preliminary results of my investigation into those processes using multiplane 2P microscopy and anatomical registration techniques.




## Cell-type-specific burst firing, synchronization and stimulus tuning in awake monkey V1

Irene Onorato

Vinck Lab, Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience, 60528 Frankfurt am Main, Germany

[irene.onorato@esi-frankfurt.de](mailto:irene.onorato@esi-frankfurt.de)

Abstract  

Cortical computation depends on interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The contributions of distinct neuron-types to sensory processing and network synchronization in primate visual-cortex remain undetermined. 

We show that in awake macaque V1, there is a unique cell-type (30% of the neurons) that has narrow-waveform action-potentials, high spontaneous discharge-rates, and fires in high-frequency bursts. These neurons are more stimulus-selective and phase-locked to gamma (30-80Hz) oscillations as compared to other neuron types, and are highly stimulus-selective as compared to other neuron types. Unlike the other neuron-types, their gamma phase-locking is highly predictive of their orientation tuning. 

We find signatures of strong rhythmic inhibition in these neurons, suggesting that they cooperate with interneurons to act as excitatory pacemakers for the V1 gamma rhythm. These narrow-waveform, bursty neurons have not been observed in other primate cortical areas or rodent V1, but resemble the excitatory ``chattering'' neurons previously described in anesthetized cat V1. Given its properties, this neuron type should be pivotal for the encoding and transmission of V1 stimulus information.




## Neuronal representation of learned category rules in mouse medial prefrontal cortex

Abstract  

Neuronal representation of learned category rules in mouse medial prefrontal cortex \
Categorization is a learning strategy for forming meaningful groups of objects and experiences. Learning a rule to categorize stimuli allows generalization of existing associations to novel stimuli, thereby aiding adaptive behavioral responses. In order to study representations of learned rules in the brain, we investigated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice engaged in a rule-based, visual category learning paradigm.

Mice (n=11) were trained to sort visual stimuli (oriented gratings, varying in orientation and spatial frequency) into a rewarded (go) and a non-rewarded (no-go) category. Individual mice took up to 50 sessions of 150-200 trials each to discriminate categories of 9 versus 9 stimuli according to a rule, e.g. to group stimuli by their spatial frequency. Intriguingly, all mice could generalize the learned rule to 18 novel stimuli within a single training session. Learning a new rule to categorize the same stimuli, like to group stimuli by their orientation, took the trained mice between 6 and 10 sessions. 

In order to investigate the underlying neuronal mechanisms, we followed individual mPFC neurons throughout the course of learning using two-photon calcium imaging. This revealed a sparse set of L2/3 mPFC neurons that, after learning, responded selectively to stimuli belonging to one of the two categories. These category selective responses evolved at different time points during the learning process and we found that the neurons’ activity was differentially modulated by other task components, such as reward or motor behavior. 

Our findings show that the prefrontal cortex in mice carries internal representations of learned rules. As a next step, we aim to investigate the circuits giving rise to such representations by using optogenetic interventions and input tracing.




## Facial Expression of Emotion in Mice and Their Neural Correlates

Nejc Dolensek 

Circuits for Emotion Department, Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, 82152 Martinsried, German

[ndolensek@neuro.mpg.de](mailto:ndolensek@neuro.mpg.de)

Abstract  

Current research into the neural circuits underlying emotional and motivated behaviour relies on animal models, which offer only limited and indirect access to their subjective experience. Using video-based analysis in head-fixed mice, we here provide for the first time evidence that mice exhibit a diverse repertoire of stereotyped facial expressions in response to different aversive and appetitive stimuli, as well as upon optogenetic activity manipulations in circuits thought to underlie valence and emotional processing. Indeed, facial tracking was able to uncover the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus experienced under different homeostatic or affective states revealing the subjective evaluation of the stimulus valence by individual mice. Furthermore, combining face tracking with functional two-photon imaging, we were able to identify single neurons in the posterior insular cortex whose activity was highly correlated with affective facial expressions and thus revealed the changing value of otherwise identical sensory stimuli. Taken together, our results demonstrate that facial expressions in laboratory mice provide a unique opportunity to infer the subjective evaluation of distinct experiences, making the study of the neural correlates of emotional experiences and states in laboratory animals feasible at an unprecedented level.


## Myelinating Schwann cells restrict axonal calibers via CMTM6

Maria Eichel 

Department of Neurogenetics, Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine, 37075 Göttingen, Germany

[eichel@em.mpg.de](mailto:eichel@em.mpg.de)

Abstract

Myelination of axons accelerates nerve impulse propagation 20–100-fold, theoretically allowing rapid nerve conduction with reduced axonal calibers. However, to our knowledge no myelin-dependent signal has been reported to restrict axonal size. Indeed, the only myelin-to-axon signal known to affect axonal size, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), actually enhances the radial growth of myelinated axons. By label-free proteomics we identified CMTM6 (chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL-transmembrane domain-containing protein 6) as a novel myelin constituent in the peripheral nervous system, in which it specifically localizes to the adaxonal surface of myelinating Schwann cells. By structure prediction, CMTM6 is a tetraspan-transmembrane protein with a chemokine-like motif in its second extracellular loop, which is exposed to the myelinated axon. Genetic disruption in Cmtm6-mutant mice causes a substantial increase of axonal calibers, accelerated sensory nerve conduction and enhanced sensory responses. Notably, myelin biogenesis, sorting of axons out of Remak bundles and axonal integrity are not impaired when Schwann cells lack CMTM6. We are currently investigating the molecular interplay between CMTM6, its interaction partner CD274 (also termed PD-L1) and MAG. Our data imply that myelinating Schwann cells utilize CMTM6 to restrict radial growth of myelinated axons.




## Transcriptional characterization of developing motion-sensing neurons in Drosophila

Nikolai Hoermann

[hoermann@neuro.mpg.de](mailto:hoermann@neuro.mpg.de)

Abstract

Within the motion-vision-circuit of Drosophila melanogaster, T4/T5 neurons are the first neurons that respond selectively to the direction of motion. Both T4 and T5 cells are further divided into four subtypes(a-d) that each responds to one of the four cardinal directions. The morphological differences between subtypes are (a) their dendrites pointing into the direction that is opposite to the direction of motion they respond to, and (b) their axon terminals arborizing in different layers of the lobula plate. A wiring diagram of the adult fly revealed the same spatial segregation of presynaptic inputs on the T4 dendrites for every subtype relative to the dendritic orientation. Therefore, the location of synaptic connections to T4 neurons appears necessary for their functional properties. However, we do not yet understand the directional growth or emergence of specific wiring on the T4 dendrite during development.

To address these questions, we want to identify the molecular mechanisms that are involved in directing the dendritic growth and in determining the column where to make synaptic contact to their specific input neurons. We first characterized the dendritic growth using fixed and live samples to determine the important, developmental time points. Thereafter, we utilized the 10x platform to conduct single cell RNA sequencing at the previously defined stages. We are using an unsupervised clustering algorithm to group cells in an unbiased way only using their expression profile. Our method can separate T4 and T5 as well as subtypes a/b and c/d in the adult dataset. In the next step, we will apply the same analysis during development, allowing us to compare expression levels between subtypes and time points. This approach will hopefully allow us to describe the genetic code necessary for the oriented growth and compartmentalization of T4/T5 dendrites. 




## Development of inhibitory wiring specificity in mouse barrel cortex

Anjali Gour

Department of Connectomics, Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany

[anjali.gour@brain.mpg.de](mailto:anjali.gour@brain.mpg.de)

Abstract  

The development of interneurons in the cerebral cortex has been studied for their migrational origin, time of integration into the cortical plate and electrophysiological properties. The connectomic development and the development of wiring specificity of interneurons is however still largely unknown. Here, we studied 3D EM datasets from the primary somatosensory cortex in mice at postnatal ages 7, 9, 14 and 28 days to map inhibitory connectomes over ontogenetic development. We find that the specificity of inhibitory axons for subcellular components of the postsynaptic neuron is already mutually exclusive at the earliest circuit stages, but the quantitative specificity of inhibitory wiring further increases over age. This development is dependent on the type of inhibitory target preference: the synapse specificity to apical dendrites develops first, followed by wiring specificity to somata, and finally to axon initial segments (AIS). These data provide a first quantification of connectomic specificity over development in the cerebral cortex, pointing towards differential mechanisms of synaptic specificity created by enhancement of target selection over age, and selective pruning of unspecific synapses.




## Ramming and sucking: deconstructing prey capture behaviour in zebrafish larvae

Duncan Mearns

[mearns@neuro.mpg.de](mailto:mearns@neuro.mpg.de)

Abstract  

Behaviour is the final output of many neuronal processes. As such, a comprehensive characterisation of the behaviour of an animal can provide insights into the structure and function of neural circuits. Here, we deconstruct the hunting behaviour of week-old zebrafish larvae using unsupervised machine learning. We find that larvae produce a continuum of swim types that they chain together to bring prey into their anterior dorsal visual field. Fish then perform either a “ram” or “suction” capture manoeuvre. These capture manoeuvres share a common, stereotyped jaw movement; however, fish combine this jaw movement with one of several stereotyped swim types to capture prey at various distances. Our analysis thus reveals the organization of a vertebrate hunting behaviour, with the implication that different neural architectures underlie prey pursuit and capture

## Physiology of eurydendroid cells and their role in zebrafish behavior

Luigi Petrucco

[lpetrucco@neuro.mpg.de](mailto:lpetrucco@neuro.mpg.de)

Poster No.: 1

Abstract  

Neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) represent the main output channel of the cerebellum, a brain region crucial for motor control. They integrate inputs from Purkinje cells, climbing and mossy fibers and project efferent axons to control thalamic and premotor nuclei. Although many experimental paradigms and theoretical models have addressed the mechanisms of action in the cerebellum, the majority of these works have focused on the cerebellar cortex, leaving CN neurons poorly understood. Moreover, their deep anatomical location in mammals has hampered experimental attempts to describe their activity in vivo

In my PhD project, I am undertake a broad characterization of the physiology of eurydendroid cells (ECs), the zebrafish equivalent to mammalian CN neurons. I will describe preliminary results from volumetric imaging and single-cell recordings that I obtained to describe physiological responses across the entire population of ECs during sensory stimulation and motor activity

Abstract  

Dramatic life events such as the transition to motherhood usually go along with profound changes in the underlying neuronal network. In mice, newborn pups emit ultrasonic vocalizations when they are outside of the nest, triggering retrieval behavior in mothers and animals that have observed this behavior (experienced virgins), but not in naïve virgins. This behavior manifests itself in an altered single neuron activity in the auditory cortex, as usually demonstrated by electrophysiology in anesthetized or head-restrained mice: parental animals show elevated firing in auditory pyramidal neurons and modulations of the excitation/inhibition balance, particularly in layer 2/3 neurons. In addition, changes in the integration of olfactory inputs into auditory neuronal activity also seems to play an important role for the formation of parental behavior. To date, most studies investigated auditory responses only in a few neurons under anesthesia and under very constrained experimental conditions. It becomes increasingly evident that such “non-natural” experimental conditions seriously compromise neuronal activity and mostly eliminate natural influences such as attention, arousal and influences from other sensory systems. Here, we show an experimental design that overcomes these limitations and allows for studying the neural underpinnings of mouse’s parental behavior under largely natural conditions. This becomes possible by using a novel miniaturized head-mounted microscope for simultaneous calcium imaging of hundreds of neurons in awake and freely moving animals during pup retrieval behavior. Together with subsequent high-resolution two-photon microscopy, these experiments provide us with profound knowledge about parental behavior and experience-dependent social learning. At some point, this may also help us better understand related syndromes like postpartum depression or social communication disorders such as autism.

Abstract  

Persistent modifications of synaptic connection strengths are often considered to be the basis of learning and stable long-term memory. This is consistent with the observation that both the turnover and size of dendritic spines undergo prominent experience-dependent changes throughout the cortex. However, this theory is challenged by the high levels of spine turnover in the absence of experimental intervention. How information is retained in the face of constant synaptic rewiring is therefore unclear.

On average, the stimulus selectivity of individual excitatory neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) is mostly stable in spite of synaptic turnover. Here, we take advantage of small differences in the long-term functional stability of individual neurons in mouse V1 to assess the extent to which spontaneous spine turnover and the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs relate to the stability of long-term feature selectivity.

To this end, we have developed a novel approach that allows us to assess the stability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli, observe structural synaptic changes, and measure the laminar profile of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity of the same neurons. We perform chronic in vivo 2-photon imaging of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons that were sparsely transduced with a structural (mRuby2) and a functional marker (GCaMP6s) using adeno-associated viruses. We follow both the changes in functional properties and spine turnover of the very same cells for an extended period of time at short intervals. To investigate the correlation between cell stability and laminar input pattern we later re-identify the functionally and structurally characterized cells in vitro and perform laser-scanning photo-stimulation by glutamate uncaging to map the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to these cells across cortical layers. \
To date, we have generated an extensive dataset of high-frequency chronic recordings of cellular function and structure over several weeks and were able to re-identify some neurons in vitro for subsequent input mapping. We are confident that this dataset will provide the groundwork for a much better understanding of how the apparent volatility of the cortical connectome relates to the stability and robustness of cortical information processing and storage.

Abstract  

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by impaired social communication, interactions, and restricted or repetitive behaviors. Genetic factor are known to contribute to the development of ASD. Altered synaptic functionality and morphological changes are common neuropathological characteristics which have been shown in other ASD candidate genes like PTEN, SHANK3, Grin2B and Neuroligin. Genome-wide association studies have also identified the transcription factor T-Brain 1 (TBR-1) as a high-confidence gene for ASD. TBR-1 is expressed in post mitotic excitatory neurons in the neocortex and sub-cortical areas like the amygdala, where it regulates cell migration and axon outgrowth. TBR-1 haploinsufficient mice display decreased associative memory, decreased cognitive flexibly and impairments in sociability when examined for autism-like behavioral phenotypes. The lateral amygdala of TBR-1 haploinsufficient mice show diminished neuronal activation after conditioned fear memory tests suggesting an important role of this structure in mediating aversive memory. Electrophysiological recordings and morphological characterization of lateral amygdala neurons show no changes in intrinsic excitability but trend towards impairments of dendritic structures. Lateral amygdala neurons exhibit an increased mEPSC frequency and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission.TBR-1 neurons show increased input-output relationship and impairments in NMDA/AMPA receptor ratio. It remains unknown how potentially misguided thalamic and cortical axons innervating the lateral amygdala impair synaptic transmission and plasticity. Moreover, how local lateral amygdala circuit connectivity is effected by TBR-1 deficiency has yet to be investigated.

Abstract  

The Neocortex is comprised of a dense network of millions of interconnected neurons. Canonically the major output cell of this network are the Pyramidal tract neurons (PTs), which integrate a highly heterogeneous synaptic input patterns. This neurons have been extensively studied on their own, however, the surrounding interneurons and how they affect the spiking output patterns of PTs, remains a mystery. Here, we show four distinctive spiking patterns of the surrounding interneurons in the primary somatosensory area of the rat and their molecular identity. Using anesthetized rats, we perform an In-vivo cell recording of identified interneurons response to a whisker stimulation, and then we proceed to fill the aforementioned neuron with biocytin through electroporation. We recover the cell by performing an immunostaining against biocytin with either an Avidin-Biotin Complex with DAB or Streptavidin conjugated with a fluorophore, along with conjugated antibodies against key molecular markers (Somatostatin and Parvalbumin). Our research shows that molecularly identified interneurons in the somatosensory cortex have a wide range of responses to external stimuli and their physiology could shed light on the inhibitory networks underlying the response patterns of cortical output. We believe that this research is the stepping stone for a more sophisticated in-vivo model of inhibitory networks in the neocortex.

Abstract  

Excitation in neural circuits must be carefully controlled by inhibition to regulate information processing and network excitability. During development, cortical inhibitory and excitatory inputs are initially mismatched but become co-tuned or ‘balanced’ with experience. However, little is known about how excitatory-inhibitory balance is defined at most synapses, or the mechanisms for establishing or maintaining this balance at specific set-points. Here we show how coordinated long-term plasticity calibrates populations of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto mouse auditory cortical pyramidal neurons. Pairing pre- and postsynaptic activity induced plasticity at paired inputs and different forms of heterosynaptic plasticity at the strongest unpaired synapses, which required minutes of activity and dendritic Ca2+ signaling to be computed. Theoretical analysis of two different models demonstrated how the relative amount of heterosynaptic plasticity could normalize and stabilize synaptic strengths to achieve any possible excitatory-inhibitory correlation. Thus, excitatory-inhibitory balance is dynamic and cell-specific, determined by distinct plasticity rules across multiple excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

Abstract  

Male zebra finches learn their song progressively during development by copying a tutor. During the critical learning period, the song develops from an early, babbling-like subsong to a fully crystalized adult song that remains largely unchanged for the rest of the bird’s life. In adult birds, song is generated by sparse, highly stereotyped activity of projection neurons in the cortical forebrain premotor nucleus HVC. The neuronal activity forms a sequence and covers the entire song. However, how this robust sequence develops during the learning process is not yet understood. We aim to understand how sensory input and motor practice shape the neural dynamics underlying sequence production. Therefore, we perform intracellular recordings of HVC projection neurons at different developmental stages in actively singing and listening juvenile zebra finches. We found that HVC projection neurons during song production generate more frequent bursts of action potentials compared to the sparse activity observed in adult birds. This indicates a less efficient coding scheme and might explain a more variable song sequence. In addition, we wanted to test whether auditory feedback is important for shaping song performance. Therefore, we designed artificial playbacks by either switching the syllable order or the syllable pitch of the bird’s own song. Currently, we are dissecting if an error in song sequence or modified pitch has the potential to shape HVC projection cell activity.

Abstract  

Defined inhibitory neuronal populations have been characterised in the the mouse central amygdala (CeA) that receive distinguished neuronal inputs and project their axons to different brain areas, as a result, they associate with different functional aspect of the CeA. It is yet not known how diverse these distinguished neuronal population are at molecular level, and how this molecular diversity are established during embryonic and/or postnatal brain development. Here we are approaching these questions by using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique to identify neuronal sub-populations at different developmental stages. New cell clusters were sound from our scRNA-seq dataset in the early postnatal mouse brain that have not been reported. Also, new molecular markers were identified for some well-known cell populations such as PKC𝛿 + neurons and Somatostatin-expressing neurons.




## Comparing computational models for cortical micro-circuit: commonalities and differences

Abstract  

The neo-cortex supports higher cognitive functions in humans and animals. The way its neural substrate stores and processes information is a major question in neuroscience. Research in this field has been driven by the cortical micro-column hypothesis, which suggests that the cortex is composed of repeated stereotypical sub-units of around one hundred neurons [Mountcastle 1957]. Though it has been suggested that the intrinsic connectivity of the circuit is layer-structured and mostly short range [Shepard 2014], there is no clear evidence for a discrete functional sub-unit.  \
The approaches to address this issue range from electrophysiological recordings and anatomical mapping [Helmstaedter 2007] to theoretical conjectures and computational modeling [Douglas and Martin 2007]. The experimental results in vivo have inspired several computational models that simulate information processing in the micro-circuit. These models are built upon a few systematic animal studies: rat somatosensory cortex [Thomson et al 2002], cat visual cortex [Binzegger 2004] and macaque visual cortex [Jones 1991]. They differ by the complexity of the simulated network, the neuronal types used and the size of the system. All of them rely on a layered structure, but the number of considered layers varies. Also the connectivity matrix changes in respect to assumptions made, but the dynamics of layer-specific populations results similar across different networks.  \
This poster compares existing computational models to discern the minimal ingredients for a cortical micro-circuitry that reproduce in vivo recorded activity. This has a double advantage: it estimates the quality and extent of available data and reveals the existence of commonalities that persist over implementation details. The perspective of such work is to enrich the layered network with non-connectionist features, i.e. neuronal adaptation and multi-compartmental dendrites, and adapt it to recent data on human cyto- and myeloarchitecture [Zilles 2018]

Abstract  

Arousal is a core affect constituted of both bodily and subjective states that prepares an agent to respond to events of the natural environment. While the peripheral physiological components of arousal have been examined also under naturalistic conditions [2], its neural correlates were suggested mainly on the basis of simplified experimental designs.

We used virtual reality (VR) to present a highly immersive and contextually rich scenario of roller coaster rides to evoke naturalistic states of emotional arousal. Simultaneously, we recorded EEG to validate the suggested neural correlates of arousal in alpha frequency oscillations (8-12Hz) over temporo-parietal cortical areas. To find the complex link between these alpha components and the participants’ continuous subjective reports of arousal, we employed a set of complementary analytical methods coming from machine learning and deep learning.

Abstract  

Disease transmission and parasitism is thought to be one of the major costs of group living. Nonetheless, when many individuals interact, a variety of behavioral patterns emerge enhancing information processing and the ability to discriminate subtle differences in the environment. With this study, we explore how groups of fish cope with the presence of an ectoparasite and if group living facilitates disease avoidance. At the individual level, fish are manually infected and monitored for the metabolic costs and behavioral effects of the infection using physiology tests in a swim tunnel. At the group level, we use individual tracking methods and reconstruct collective dynamics and individual movement characteristics that emerge in groups containing both uninfected and infected individuals. Specifically, we ask whether groups of uninfected fish can detect and move away from infected individuals, for example using wisdom-of-the-crowd mechanisms, or via distributed mechanisms. Overall, we aim at quantifying physiological and behavioral characteristics to better understand the relationship between individual and group-level information processing in the context of antiparasite defense.

Abstract  

Resting state neuronal activity in EEG/MEG recordings is primarily characterized by the presence of alpha oscillations (approx. 8-12 Hz). However, their functional significance and link to cognitive task performance remains elusive. We investigated resting state neuronal activity and its relation to task performance by assessing traditional measures of alpha activity (power and individual alpha peak frequency) and dynamic properties of the signal measured by long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). Multichannel EEG was recorded at rest in 82 healthy male adults and compared to their cognitive performance, measured by tests involving executive functions, working memory, short- and long-term memory demands. Our results showed that attention-span scores positively correlated with alpha power at rest, with corresponding neuronal sources located primarily in the left-hemispheric anterior cingulate cortex, parietal regions, and bilateral supplementary motor areas. Furthermore, better working memory performance was related to increased LRTC of alpha oscillations at rest in the right hemispheric fronto-parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. Our findings suggest that resting state neuronal activity may reflect properties of brain networks that are functionally relevant for cognitive task performance. While alpha power measured at rest might relate to tasks that employ sustained inhibitory control, LRTC are suggested to reflect the capacity of neuronal networks to perform tasks that require phasic attention and quick adaptation to changing task demands.

Abstract  

The advancements in subcellular-resolution connectomics and the reconstruction of neurons and their synaptic connectivity have made it possible to find general principles of wiring across a wide range of brain systems. Here we present a connectomics analysis of subcellular specificities in serial block-face electron microscopy (EM) data in human (Medial Temporal Gyrus, Brodmann area 21) and macaque (Primary Somatosensory) cortices. This is achieved by extending SegEM (Berning et al 2015 Neuron) for automated dense reconstruction and analysis of the 3D EM data. We find higher fraction of interneurons in primate brain as compared to rodents. We investigate the role of this enhanced interneuron fraction by quantifying the density of synapses at subcellular targets of inhibition, primarily somata and axon initial segments, and measuring the wiring precision of axons innervating these targets. We aim to discover the species-specific features of neuronal connectivity and understand how small variations in neural wiring may form the foundation for changes in structural motifs in these higher species.

Abstract  

The human gut harbors about one hundred trillion microbes that play an important role in host health and homeostasis. According to several reports, a change in microbial species composition can impact brain function by modulating protein expression and metabolite levels. There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiota and its released compounds are involved in the mental disorders. However, the complex network of crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the brain is only starting to be understood. In the project, we will use metaproteomics and metabolomics techniques to investigate the proteome and metabolome expressed by microbial communities. Identifying microbiome proteome and metabolome alterations of a dysfunctional gut-brain-axis will contribute to our understanding of the neurobiological basis of disease development, and will provide biosignatures for the assessment of mental disorders. This will provide information on the role of gut microbiota for the development of mental disorders with the ultimate goal to improve patient diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract  

Sighted animals use visual information to control their trajectories during locomotion. One aspect of this is the processing of visual feedback arising from self-motion, which is important to detect and counteract course deviations. The working principles and neuronal implementations of such stabilizing feedback systems are poorly understood.

Here, we explore the behavioural role of horizontal optic flow sensors (HS cells) for steering behaviour in an insect, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. First, we established genetic tools to control neuronal activity in the visual system with light via the cell-specific expression of photosensitive ion channels. Subsequently, we used these tools to evoke HS cell-specific de- and hyperpolarization during tethered walking behaviour. These manipulations elicited opposite turning behaviour but in both cases syn-directional with the mimicked visual motion direction, supporting the idea that HS cells convey positive and negative visual error signals for yaw course stabilization. In our ongoing work, we investigate the role of optic flow sensors during free behaviour.

Abstract  

Pyramidal tract (PT) neurons are the major output celltype of neocortex. They have large dendritic trees spanning all layers, receiving both intracortical and long range inputs. It has been shown, that the abundance of active conducances these cells express along their dendrites leads to highly nonlinear dynamics. Therefore, it is commonly assumed, that PT neurons must integrate synaptic input in a nonlinear way.

Here, we characterize a regime of spatiotemporal excitatory and inhibitory input patterns, that enables PT neurons to integrate input linearly. For such input, active dendritic conductances and morphological diversity only have a minimal effect on the spiking output. This allows PT neurons to have robust responses despite the large morphological and biophysical inter-cell variability that is typically oberserved for this celltype.

Combining in vivo electrophysiology with previously reported anatomical data, we show, that input statistics within that input regime are present during the onset of sensory evoked responses in vivo. We derive a linear model from the linear input output relationship of PT neurons and demonstrate that this model is able to reproduce onset responses of passive whisker touch in vivo. This can be a starting point to investigate which information is encoded in the so far enigmatic onset response of the PT neuron population.




## Cellular mechanism of direction selectivity in the Drosophila ON pathway

Abstract  

Identifying the direction of motion within a visual scene is essential for the survival of sighted animals. In Drosophila, T4 and T5 neurons are the first neurons along the visual processing chain that respond to visual motion in a direction-selective manner]. 

T4 cells process the motion signaled by light increments (ON pathway) whereas the T5 cells process the motion signaled by light decrements (OFF pathway). 

To describe how such direction selective responses in T4 and T5 come about, a detector model based on the interaction of three spatially and temporally distinct inputs was proposed recently. This model relies on the comparison of signals originating from neighboring points in space via a delay-and-compare mechanism. Among the neurons that form direct connections to T4 dendrites, the medulla intrinsic neuron Mi9 shows particularly interesting properties. Despite being located in the ON pathway Mi9 has an OFF center receptive field. 

By combining 2-photon glutamate imaging with immunohistochemistry we show that Mi9 uses glutamate as its transmitter. Invertebrates like Drosophila melanogaster possess a glutamate-gated chloride channel called GluClα which is generally inhibitory. Based on the expression pattern and spatial distribution of GluClα on T4 dendrites we propose this receptor as a candidate for the interaction between Mi9 and the motion-sensitive T4. Computer simulations have shown that such a two-fold signal inversion can form the biophysical basis for enhancing the direction selectivity in T4 cells. To probe this model, we knock down the expression of GluClα on T4 dendrites and test the functional role of this neurotransmitter receptor in the computation of direction selectivity.


## Neural Representation of Tutor Song Memory and Birds Own Song in NIf of Adult Zebra Finches

Abstract  

For male zebra finches, auditory signals are the primary sensory source to learn their song. These animals need to listen to their father in order to copy his song during a critical period of 90 days post hatching. We want to understand the mechanisms that allow the acoustic signal of the tutor song to be stored in the brain and to be transformed into a motor program in order to generate an own song. To do this, we examine the neural representation of the own song (BOS) versus tutor song in the nucleus interfacialis of the nidopallium (NIf). NIf is a sensorimotor nucleus in the auditory pathway and provides the main auditory input to the cortical premotor nucleus HVC, which connects several pathways in the song system and has been shown to be necessary for song learning (Roberts et al., 2012).

We are recording intracellularly with sharp glass electrodes from identified NIf HVC projection neurons in awake, head-fixed, actively listening adult zebra finches, while presenting different auditory playbacks. To be able to determine precise differences in the BOS versus the tutor song we replaced the father with an artificial tutor consisting of only two syllables ‘ABAB’. Juveniles were then trained with the artificial tutor song which enables us to determine which part of the song is copied well. To determine how auditory input influences the motor sequence, we presented the artificial tutor song and the BOS, while recording from identified NIf-HVC projection neurons. So far, we recorded from 8 projection neurons in adult zebra finches. The preliminary results suggest that NIf-HVC neurons display a different activation pattern during bird’s own song and tutor song playback and we hypothesis that NIf may play a regulatory role in how auditory information is provided to HVC via gating by inhibitory interneurons.

Abstract  

Growing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an important class of regulatory RNAs. Although circRNAs have been shown to be the most prevalent in the brain compared to other tissue, the processes governing their biogenesis in neurons are still elusive. Moreover, it is unknown whether and how different biogenesis factors work in synchrony to generate circRNAs. To address this question, we pharmacologically inhibited the spliceosome and profiled rat neuronal circRNAs using RNA-sequencing. We identified over 100 circRNAs that were up-regulated and a few circRNAs that were down-regulated upon spliceosome inhibition. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that up-regulated circRNAs possess significantly longer flanking introns compared to the un-changed circRNA population. Moreover, the flanking introns of up-regulated circRNAs possess, on average, a higher number of distinct repeat sequences and harbor more reverse complementary motifs compared to the un-changed circRNAs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the biogenesis of circRNAs containing distinct intronic features becomes favored under conditions of limited spliceosome activity.

Abstract  

Little research has been done into understanding the mechanisms in the brain related to migration, mainly due to the difficulties of controlling the variables related to migratory behavior. We will study different populations of exclusively resident and migrant blackbirds. These populations show similar breeding and wintering times, except that the resident groups do not migrate while migrant groups face autumn and spring migration. The field work will happen in two steps: first, collecting data in a semi-controlled environment, and second, then using the data collected previously to measure changes in the populations in order to synchronize brain dissections for the distinct groups. We will take measurements from the brains to find possible differences between the resident and migrant groups associated with migration.

We will measure the changes that animals undergo after the breeding period preceding autumn migration, and in their winter grounds preceding spring migration. This will happen with birds in an aviary exposed to their local external environment with controlled food and water and with wild birds for comparison. The measurements in the winter grounds will be made together with a collection of feathers to test stable isotopes and identify their breeding location and consequently, if they are migrant or resident. \
The following year, we will again place animals in the semi-controlled aviary environment after the breeding season and follow their changes until the time of brain dissection. \
We will capture individuals from at least five populations for each different wintering strategy. They will be captured at three times of the year: before the autumnal migration, in their wintering ground, and after the spring migration.




## PMP22 dosage perturbs the homeostasis of the major growth inhibitor PTEN in disease models of CMT1A and HNPP

Abstract  

Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) is an integral transmembrane protein in the Schwann Cell (SC) myelin sheath. The correct gene dosage of PMP22 is crucial for proper myelination. PMP22 overexpression causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1A (CMT1A), which is characterized by a dysmyelination and shortened internodes accompanied by a reduced nerve conduction velocity (NCV). In turn, PMP22 heterozygosity leads to tomacula formation, a focal thickening of myelin at the nodes of ranvier and the clinical hallmark of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Previously, we demonstrated a decrease in PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation in a Pmp22 transgenic rat model of CMT1A and an increase in a mouse model of HNPP, indicating that PMP22 is involved in myelin growth signaling via PI3K/Akt/mTOR. However, the molecular interaction partners of PMP22 and the mechanism how these change intracellular signaling pathways remain unknown. We observed increased levels of the PI3K inhibitor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in the PMP22 overexpressing SC and decreased levels in the HNPP situation. PTEN localizes to the abaxonal cytoplasmic Cajal bands of the Schwann cell. On the one hand, inhibiting mTOR in an animal model of HNPP improves the phenotype and reduces myelin abnormalities. On the other hand, inhibiting PTEN in a myelinating co-culture system of CMT1A rats improves the degree of myelination in vitro. We hypothesize that PMP22 interacts with PTEN at the abaxonal site of the myelinating SC, thereby controlling myelination via signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

Abstract  

Mapping neuronal wires for a mechanistic understanding of computation in the brain is a major goal of high-resolution connectomics. While acquisition of mm3-sized 3D electron microscopy datasets is becoming feasible, axon reconstruction remains the main bottleneck. Here, we present a new framework to automatically trace axons in 3D-EM data, where a convolutional neural network is trained end to end in a supervised fashion to predict neurite continuation from EM images. Integration of the prediction and application of the network in a recurrent manner yields a sparse skeleton representation of axonal branches. Application of this framework on linear branches of axons in a 3D-EM dataset from mouse primary somatosensory cortex layer 4 results in error rates that make it plausible to deploy the framework in conjunction with existing automated reconstruction approaches in order to further reduce the human annotation needs in connectomics.

Abstract  

Different types of neurons are characterized by their distinct dendritic and axonal morphology, which are supposed to have a high impact on the neuron’s function. A prominent example of the close relation between the function and morphology in neurons are the so-called T4 and T5 neurons (T4/T5), the first direction-selective neurons in the fruit fly visual system. In the Drosophila optic lobe, there exist four subtypes of both T4 and T5. Each subtype is responsive to motion in one of the four cardinal directions, which is called their ‘preferred direction’. However, the four subtypes were shown to have similar physiological properties and share the same presynaptic input cells. This raises the question of how these different subtypes acquire different direction selectivity preferences? One major morphological difference that was shown to differentiate these subtypes is the orientation of their dendrites. Each T4/T5 neuron has its dendrites oriented primarily in one direction, which is opposite to its preferred direction. This morphological characteristic is believed to be fundamental for the direction selectivity in T4/T5 neurons. Another difference between the subtypes is their axonal target layer in the lobula plate, which determines the proper connections to their postsynaptic partners. Our work focuses on identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the individual T4/T5 subtypes that gives rise to their distinctive morphological features. For this, we determined the transcriptome of individual T4/T5 subtypes and looked for genes that are differentially expressed. We indeed were able to identify genes that are expressed specifically in a single T4/T5 subtype only. These genes encode proteins of the family ‘beaten path’, a group of anti-adhesion molecules that were previously shown to be involved in axon guidance. We also found that a knockout mutation of one of these genes disrupt the whole optic lobe of Drosophila. we plan next to further characterize the role of the beaten path on T4/T5 development, and identify more genes involved in the process of T4/T5 differentiation into the different subtypes.

Abstract  

The analysis of interactions among local populations of neurons in the cerebral cortex (e.g. within cortical microcolumns) requires high resolution, simultaneous recordings from chronically implanted arrays of laminar microelectrodes. To this end, we examined the options to chronically implant silicon based laminar probes, produced with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, to record from monkey primary visual cortex (V1). We used a passive NeuroSeeker CMOS probe that had 128 contact points arranged in 4 columns and 32 rows on one laminar shaft. From this probe we recorded simultaneously Local Field Potentials (LFP) and spiking Multi-Unit Activity (MUA) in V1 of an awake behaving macaque monkey. We found that insertion through the dura and subsequent readjustments of the chronically implanted electrode were possible and allowed us to record stable LFPs for more than five months. MUA quality degraded within the first month but remained sufficiently high to permit mapping of receptive fields during the full recording period. We conclude that the NeuroSeeker CMOS laminar probe enables semi-chronic recordings of high quality of LFP and MUA for a time span exceeding five months.

Abstract  

Severe stress during childhood is a global problem with long-lasting negative behavioral and physiological consequences in adulthood, which increase the risk for stress-related disorders, such as depression. Human genetic studies showed a profound link between FKBP51 expression and the risk for stress-related disorders. In animal studies, deletion of FKBP51 results in a more resilient phenotype after chronic stress in adulthood. This study aims to disentangle the influence of FKBP51 after chronic stress during early life. Here, the early life stress (ELS) limited nesting and bedding material protocol was performed to investigate the consequences of ELS on cognition, fear memory and social behavior during adolescence and different time-points in adulthood. Also, the pharmacological inhibition of FKBP51 with SAFit2 was executed in order to investigate whether SAfit2 can reverse the negative effects of ELS in adulthood. The first results show an ELS induced increased HPA-axis reactivity in an age dependent matter, as 3 months old mice showed increased adrenal weight, but 5 months old animals did not. Moreover, specifically in 5 months old mice the ELS protocol worsened the performance on object recognition, which was not influenced by SAfit2 treatment. However, auditory fear memory was enhanced in 5 months old, SAFit2 treated animals, but only after exposure to ELS. The contextual fear memory was not altered by ELS or SAFit2 treatment. This study provides insights to further unravel the effects of chronic stress in early life on later time periods in life. Moreover, the rationale for investigating the pharmacological inhibition of FKBP51 as a possible treatment for chronic stress is provided. Future study will include SAFit2 treatment during ELS, which might alter the outcome of ELS in adulthood.

Abstract  

The ability to distinguish the direction of moving visual cues is vital to animals relying on sight. In Drosophila, T4 and T5 cells are the first neurons in the visual chain which are able to make that distinction. To describe this direction selectivity, a three-arm detector model was proposed. It is via a delay-and-compare mechanism that this model compares neighboring signals coming from different points in the visual space. In this model, the central arm outputs a fast excitation while the two flanking arms provide a slow inhibition. One of these flanking arms emphasizes responses to a preferred direction whereas the other flanking arm inhibits responses to a non-preferred direction.

According to connectome data, all cellular inputs onto T4 and T5 cells have been mapped making it possible to dissect the mechanisms through which the computation of direction selectivity is implemented on a cellular level. To do so, one strategy is to reconstruct the mechanisms leading to a direction selective response of T4 and T5 cells through the artificial manipulation of the inputs made onto these same T4 and T5 neurons. To investigate the mechanism through which preferred direction responses on T4 arise, we combine local application of neurotransmitter puffs and the use of optogenetic tools on the presynaptic partners of T4 and T5 neurons.

Abstract  

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic, recurrent mental illness. However, the pathophysiology and underlying biochemical/molecular events leading to MDD remain largely unknown. Significant drawbacks of currently used antidepressants have prompted the study of their action mechanism and discovery of novel antidepressants. Ketamine, commonly used for starting and maintaining anesthesia, has demonstrated a great potential to become a new antidepressant. But the mechanism of this effect is still unclear. So the development of novel antidepressants is in great demand. In order to uncover the mechanism of action of antidepressants, here we take advantage of two powerful approaches to analysis of drug-protein interaction based on Mass spectrometry proteomics to identify novel protein targets of potential novel antidepressant ketamine.

Abstract  

In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, motion vision has been widely studied. The elucidation of neuronal connections and cell dynamics have led to the development of the current motion detection model. This model implements both preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression at the level of T4/T5 dendrites. However, the implementation of direction selectivity at the molecular level on the dendrites of T4/T5 neurons is still being uncovered. It is known that different input neurons synapse onto the dendrite at different locations, and we, therefore, wondered whether the cell expresses a particular receptor also at specific locations. The neurotransmitter receptors expressed on T4/T5 neurons are not specific for these cell types but rather expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain. Thus, the ability to manipulate a single receptor type on a particular class of neurons such as T4/T5 is indispensable. To this avail, we have developed a GFP-tagged overexpression line of a neurotransmitter receptor of interest that allows for the labeling of this receptor on a single dendrite. Additionally, we are developing an endogenous protein tagging strategy to do the same. Together, these tools will help reveal the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors along T4/T5 dendrites.

Abstract  

Detecting direction of motion is of prime importance for all species that rely on vision for behaviour. In the fly visual system, T4 and T5 emerge as the first cells, where local direction of motion is computed in two parallel ON and OFF pathways respectively. Classically two opposing models have been proposed for implementation of direction selectivity. Both these models use two input lines, where one of the input line has been asymmetrically delayed compared to other, which is then followed by a nonlinear interaction. The Hassenstein-Reichardt (HR) model, proposes a Preferred Direction (PD) enhancement, while Barlow-Levick (BL) model proposes a null direction suppression. Recent findings however have shown that both these mechanisms are implemented together in T4 and T5 cells. The direct neural correlates for implementation of these models, however have not been established yet. Here we optogenetically silence individual laminar and medullar input neurons to T4 cells, while simultaneously recording from T4 using 2P Calcium imaging. We aim to find input cell types implementing the direct line, PD enhancement and ND suppression respectively, while also establishing the contribution from laminar input cell types, at the level of T4 cells. This will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of neural correlates for implementation of direction selective circuits in Drosophila.

Abstract  

Stress has a critical role in the development of many psychiatric conditions, including anxiety disorders. Stress is also known to limit the efficacy of behavioral therapies, such as exposure therapy which is based on extinction learning. However, the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how stress and possibly other internal states may influence fear and extinction learning have not been fully resolved. Since the posterior insular cortex (pIC) is crucially involved in interoception and has been proposed to process internal affective and homeostatic states, we here addressed a potential role for the pIC in the extinction of learned fear. 

Using both fiber photometry recordings of excitatory neuronal populations and electrophysiological single-unit recordings in the pIC, we found state-dependent processing of fear-eliciting cues. Interestingly, CS+ tone-evoked pIC activities were correlated with fear-expression specifically during phases of learning when the associative meaning of the CS+ changes. Furthermore, we found that overall pIC activity decreases during freezing episodes.

Optogenetic manipulations of the pIC during extinction learning revealed a surprising bidirectional effect: while pIC silencing facilitated extinction learning after a weak fear conditioning (FC) protocol, the same circuit manipulation impaired fear extinction learning following a strong FC. To confirm that the bidirectional effect truly varied with the strength of the conditioning, we exposed animals sequentially to weak and then strong FC. In agreement with the previous results, conditioning strength predicted the outcome of pIC inhibition on extinction performance. This effect becomes more evident when separating animals into high and low fear groups according to their freezing levels during recall, suggesting that the internal anxiety state of an animal predicts the direction of change in extinction performance upon pIC silencing.  \
In summary, our data suggest that the pIC may either promote or inhibit fear extinction dependent on the anxiety state of the animal

Abstract  

Learned motor behaviors are often shaped by social influences. Human infants learn their first words by imitating their parents and observing their feedback. Similar to human vocal learning, young zebra finches learn their song from their fathers. To some extend young birds are also able to learn to imitate from playbacks of tutor song. However, the contribution of female zebra finches to song learning is less clear. We 1) investigate whether the presence of a female supports song learning, 2) characterize the vocal feedback of females during song practice of juveniles and 3) measure the impact of female feedback onto the premotor circuitry. We find, that female zebra finches have an impact on the learned song tempo i.e. zebra finches, that were raised with a female copied song tempo more accurately compared to birds, that grew up socially isolated. Female birds give feedback by calling before, during or shortly after a song practiced by a juvenile. We performed intracellular recordings in awake and listening juvenile zebra finches while presenting playbacks of songs that were accompanied with female calls. We found that a female call had the potential to elicit changes in spike firing rate and subthreshold activity in premotor neurons. We hypothesize that female feedback contributes to neural plasticity within a premotor circuit which leads to improved learning of the song tempo in juvenile zebra finches.

Abstract  

Identifying the direction of motion within a visual scene is essential for survival of all sighted animals. In Drosophila, T4 and T5 neurons are the first neurons along the visual processing chain that respond to visual motion in a direction selective way. To describe how such direction selective responses in T4 and T5 come about, a so called 3-arm detector model was proposed recently. This model relies on the comparison of signals originating from neighboring points in space via a delay-and-compare mechanism. The central arm provides fast excitation to the neuron, while the two flanking arms possess slow dynamics, one amplifying the central signal implementing for stimuli moving along the preferred direction, the other inhibiting the central signal for stimuli moving along the null direction of the neuron.

For the cellular implementation of this model, the organization of transmitter receptors on T4 and T5 dendrites plays a crucial role. An asymmetric distribution of excitatory vs. inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors along T4/T5 dendrites, for instance, is one possibility that could account for such a mechanism. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyze the expression pattern and spatial distribution of receptors on T4/T5 dendrites with the goal to link the anatomical phenotype to the functional role of neurotransmitter receptors in the computation of direction selectivity.

Abstract  

Spatially-tuned neurons in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit are thought to play a key role in the neural representation of both the environment and self-location. Spatial representations are critically dependent on environmental features however, where geometric borders in particular provide a reference frame or anchor point from which the integration of movement and updating of self-location can occur. Here we characterize a new population of neurons in the rat’s retrosplenial cortex that robustly encode this border information in terms of distance and orientation towards the closest boundary, all from a body-centric perspective. Their activity profiles were invariant to geometric shape and wall manipulations, yet highly specific to edges as external objects elicited no response. The egocentric component was furthermore resistant to experimental rotations, indicating activity is generated independent of the head direction signal. Together, these egocentric border cells can provide critical boundary information for path-integration based computations and allows for alignment of representations to the environmental geometry.




## Activity Manipulation Dependent Proteomic Changes in Synaptic Scaling

Abstract  

The brain regulates the synaptic strengths to process and store information, and neurons implement homeostatic mechanisms to keep this regulation under control. This homeostatic response acts in the opposite direction of the prolonged activity, and synaptic protein turnover modulates the global up- or down- regulation of the synaptic strengths. Recent developments in proteomics allow us to study the changes in the whole proteome induced by chemical treatments in a time dependent manner. \
In this study, we investigate the protein regulation and interactions using the proteomic data from activity manipulated hippocampal cultures in 2h and 24h timepoints [1]. We propose a machine learning pipeline to predict the time and duration of the manipulation, therefore the direction of the scaling when protein intensities for the whole proteome are given. After training the model, we also test it using an external dataset which comes from a different experimental setup [2]. This model can correctly predict the type and duration of the manipulation with 93% and 83% accuracy for the original and external datasets, respectively. Results show that we can infer the direction of the scaling, and this model can generalise for other experimental methods as well.

Furthermore, we use this model to analyse the weights and important features of the classifier and apply gene set enrichment analysis to further investigate the relationships among various protein groups and ultimately aim to extract the time dependent interaction of proteins in the context of synaptic scaling. \

Abstract  

Cortical excitability fluctuates over time thus leading to variability in perception of identical stimuli. So far, this phenomenon has typically been investigated analyzing pre-stimulus oscillatory patterns in EEG and MEG data. However, the analysis of oscillatory activity lacks the direct link between ongoing brain activity and cortex excitation. Therefore, we propose a new (complementary) approach to observe changes in cortical excitability over time, by probing the ongoing brain activity with somatosensory stimuli (i.e. median nerve stimulation). The N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) in the EEG reflects the first excitatory post-synaptic potentials arriving from the thalamus to the cortex thus being a direct measurement of cortex excitation when stimulus information enters primary sensory areas. In our study, we measured single-trial variability of early SEPs over time and investigated their temporal pattern. Amplitude fluctuations of early SEPs exhibited power-law dynamics over trials pointing out that cortical excitability does not fluctuate at random but shows long-lasting auto-correlations over time. This is consistent with the hypothesis that neuronal circuits also in primary somatosensory areas operate at the transition point between robustness to perturbations and flexibility to adapt to changes, that is at the critical state.
